    description: "The first-generation Mazda6 (known as Atenza in Japan) replaced the 626 as Mazda's mid-size offering, introducing more distinctive styling and sportier driving dynamics to the segment. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon body styles (though North America received only sedan and hatchback initially, with the wagon added later), it was built on Mazda's G platform. Powertrain options in North America included a 2.3L four-cylinder producing 160 horsepower and a 3.0L V6 with 220 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual, four-speed automatic, or five-speed automatic depending on engine. European markets also received various diesel engines. The Mazdaspeed6 (2006-2007) featured a turbocharged 2.3L direct-injection engine producing 274 horsepower, paired with a six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. The interior offered a driver-focused design with good ergonomics, available features including automatic climate control, Bose audio, and heated leather seats. This generation established the Mazda6 as a sportier alternative to mainstream mid-size sedans, emphasizing handling and driver engagement while offering competitive practicality and value."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda6 refined the formula of its predecessor with more sophisticated styling, improved interior quality, and enhanced technology while maintaining its focus on driving dynamics. The exterior design evolved with more fluid styling, a prominent front grille, and an overall more upscale appearance. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon body styles in global markets, though North America received only the sedan. Powertrain options in North America included a revised 2.5L four-cylinder replacing the 2.3L, producing 170 horsepower, and a carried-over 3.0L V6 with 272 horsepower. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and five-speed automatic with the four-cylinder, and six-speed automatic with the V6. European markets received additional engine options including several diesels. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology, with available features including dual-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth connectivity, and blind spot monitoring system—one of the first mainstream mid-size sedans to offer this feature. A refresh in 2011 brought subtle styling updates and technology enhancements. This generation maintained the Mazda6's reputation for above-average driving dynamics in the mid-size segment while addressing previous criticisms regarding refinement and feature content."

    description: "The third-generation Mazda6 represented a dramatic advancement, introducing Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language and SkyActiv technology suite. The exterior featured striking, premium styling with flowing lines, a bold front fascia, and athletic proportions. Available as a sedan and wagon globally, though North America received only the sedan. Initially powered by SkyActiv-G engines including a 2.5L four-cylinder with 184 horsepower, paired with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions. A diesel option was available in some markets but repeatedly delayed and ultimately never offered in North America. A significant refresh in 2018 brought revised exterior styling, a thoroughly updated interior with higher quality materials, and a new turbocharged 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The cabin featured a premium design with exceptional material quality for its class, including available Nappa leather and Japanese Sen wood trim. Technology expanded to include an 8-inch infotainment system with rotary controller, 11-speaker Bose audio, head-up display, and comprehensive safety features through i-Activsense. Further updates in 2021 added standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, along with trim and feature refinements. Throughout its production, the third-generation Mazda6 has been acclaimed for its upscale design, refined driving dynamics, and premium interior quality, positioning it as a near-luxury alternative in the mainstream mid-size sedan segment despite modest sales compared to segment leaders."
