    description: "The first-generation Mazda6 (known as Atenza in Japan) replaced the 626 as Mazda's mid-size offering, introducing more distinctive styling and sportier driving dynamics to the segment. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon body styles (though North America received only sedan and hatchback initially, with the wagon added later), it was built on Mazda's G platform. Powertrain options in North America included a 2.3L four-cylinder producing 160 horsepower and a 3.0L V6 with 220 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual, four-speed automatic, or five-speed automatic depending on engine. European markets also received various diesel engines. The Mazdaspeed6 (2006-2007) featured a turbocharged 2.3L direct-injection engine producing 274 horsepower, paired with a six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. The interior offered a driver-focused design with good ergonomics, available features including automatic climate control, Bose audio, and heated leather seats. This generation established the Mazda6 as a sportier alternative to mainstream mid-size sedans, emphasizing handling and driver engagement while offering competitive practicality and value."

Transmission choices included six-speed manual and five-speed automatic with the four-cylinder, and six-speed automatic with the V6. European markets received additional engine options including several diesels. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology, with available features including dual-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth connectivity, and blind spot monitoring systemâ€”one of the first mainstream mid-size sedans to offer this feature.

Throughout its production, the third-generation Mazda6 has been acclaimed for its upscale design, refined driving dynamics, and premium interior quality, positioning it as a near-luxury alternative in the mainstream mid-size sedan segment despite modest sales compared to segment leaders."
